## Vowel Remover

This program takes a user-provided string and removes all vowels from it, producing a new version of the string without any `a, e, i, o, u` (both uppercase and lowercase).

---

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input a string.
2. It processes the string by removing all vowels using a custom function.
3. The modified string, with vowels removed, is displayed as the output.

## Example

#### Input:
```
Hello World!
```

#### Output:
```
Hll Wrld!
```

## Instructions to Run

2. Run the script in a Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python vowel_remover.py
   ```
3. Enter your text when prompted, and the program will display the result.
